# Final Project

## Abstract Proposal

For my final project, I'll revisit my generative sketch project. I was dissappointed in this project, as I felt it failed my artistic concept even though I spent a large amount of time on collecting the data. In revisiting this project, I'm first going to get the code to successfully generate the river sketches I wanted to acheive in the original. Then, I'll move on to modifying the generation code to "predict" a river sketch given an incomplete sketch. I plan on referencing the way the sketchRNN examples predict user input to generate an array of possible sketches. As my "user input" I will draw vector drawings of rivers I'm interested in. Ideally if i have time I would use edge detection to fully automate this vector drawing proccess so I could just input the satellite image of the river I'm interested in--but I feel that is too ambitious of a plan considering the limited amount of time I have. As far as presenting, I will introduce the work of Carolina Caycedo as the inspiration for my project, especially my interest in Caycedo's use of scale, inversion, and imagination and how I adapted that in my own rendition. To polish the product from an artistic standpoint, I will print the satellite images I used to generate the rivers and paint with ink on top of the path that my RNN sketches for me (I'll be using materials that I already have from taking a calligraphy course). I really enjoy the tactileness of creating art with my own hands, and I don't want to completely disconnect art from the human. In this way I want my RNN to be more of a companion to help me imagine my sketches--since in theory it should have a more nuanced understanding of the flow/shape of a river.

## Project Report

Upload your project report (4 pages) as a pdf with your repository, following this template: [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133H59WZBmH6MlAgFSskFLMQITeIC5d9b2iuzsOfa4E8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
